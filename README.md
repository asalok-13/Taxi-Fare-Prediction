# Taxi-Fare-Prediction
This project builds a machine learning regression model to predict taxi fares based on trip-related features such as pickup/drop-off locations, distance, time, and passenger count.
It demonstrates the complete data science workflow, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and explainability using Python.

🎯 Business Problem

Accurate fare prediction helps:
Improve pricing transparency
Enhance customer trust
Optimize ride-hailing operations

Objective:
Predict the taxi fare amount for a given trip using historical trip data.

🛠️ Technologies & Tools (ATS Keywords)

Python
Jupyter Notebook
Pandas, NumPy

🚕 Taxi Far Machine Learning Project


Built an end-to-end machine learning regression pipeline to predict taxi fares using historical trip data, improving pricing accuracy and transparency.
Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify fare patterns, detect outliers, and analyze relationships between distance, time, and fare amount.
Engineered geospatial features using Haversine distance and extracted time-based features (hour, weekday) to enhance model performance.
Cleaned and preprocessed large tabular datasets by handling missing values, invalid coordinates, and skewed distributions.
Implemented and compared multiple regression models including Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.
Evaluated model performance using RMSE, MAE, and R², selecting the best model based on generalization and error minimization.
Applied feature importance analysis to interpret model predictions, identifying trip distance and temporal features as key fare drivers.
Visualized insights through correlation plots, fare distributions, and model performance charts to support data-driven decision making.
Designed the project using industry-standard GitHub structure, ensuring reproducibility and recruiter-friendly documentation.
